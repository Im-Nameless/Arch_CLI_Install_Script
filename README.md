# Arch_CLI_Install_Script

Currently supports XFCE, KDE, Gnome, i3-gaps and also an option for no DE/WM
You can choose what you want to install/use simply by selecting it.

To run the scrip;
`bash install_arch.sh wizard && bash install_arch.sh install`

*test_whiptail.sh is only used to test the cli's without having to install on a VM everytime.*
